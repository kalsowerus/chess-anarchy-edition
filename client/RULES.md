# Rules
## All normal chess moves
## En arrière
If an opposing pawn moved two squares,
a pawn can capture it diagonally backwards in the next turn.

## Il vaticano
If two bishops from the same player are in the same file or rank,
with exactly two squares between them,
and both of these squares are occupied by an opponent's piece,
the bishops can swap places and capture everything between them.

## Overpromotion
Pawns can be promoted to a knook.
The knook combines the moves of a rook and a knight. 

## Knight boosting
When a pawn is promoted to a knight,
that knight can move in the same turn.

## Special move chaining
If a piece makes a special move,
it can start a chain of special moves in the same turn.

Special moves are:
- en passent
- en arrière
- il vaticano

Once a special move chain has been started,
the rules for some special moves change:
- en passent does not require the captured pawn to have moved two squares on the previous move, or at all
- en arrière does not require the captured pawn to have moved two squares on the previous move, or at all
